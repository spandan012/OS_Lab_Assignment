[Priority Scheduling]
PID BT PR WT TAT
1   5  1  0  5
2   3  2  5  8
3   4  3  8  12
Average WT = 4.33
Average TAT = 8.33

[Round Robin Scheduling] (Quantum = 2)
Gantt Chart:
P1 [0 → 2]
P2 [2 → 4]
P3 [4 → 6]
P1 [6 → 8]
P3 [8 → 10]
P1 [10 → 11]

Average WT = 4.00
Average TAT = 8.00

[Sequential File Allocation]
Total Blocks = 20
File 1 allocated from 2 to 5
File 2 allocated from 6 to 9
File 3 cannot be allocated
Final Block Map:
0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

[Indexed File Allocation]
Index Block = 4 → Data Blocks = [6, 7, 8]
Index Block = 10 already allocated
Final Block Map:
0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

[Contiguous Memory Allocation]
Partitions: 100 400 200 300
Processes: 212 417 112 426

First Fit:
P1 → Partition 2
P2 → Partition 4
P3 → Partition 3
P4 → Not allocated

Best Fit:
P1 → Partition 3
P2 → Partition 4
P3 → Partition 1
P4 → Not allocated

Worst Fit:
P1 → Partition 2
P2 → Partition 4
P3 → Partition 2
P4 → Not allocated

[MFT]
Memory = 1000, Partition = 200
P1=150 Allocated (50 internal fragmentation)
P2=300 Too large
P3=180 Allocated (20 internal fragmentation)

[MVT]
Memory = 1000
P1=300 Allocated
P2=500 Allocated
P3=300 Not enough memory
